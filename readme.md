# TDA based Summary and Distance between Sets of Texts and Distance between Literary Styles

The dataset used is part of the [CorpusSonetosSigloDeOro](https://github.com/bncolorado/CorpusSonetosSigloDeOro) repository.

* In [poets_comparison.py](https://github.com/Cimagroup/Towards-a-Philological-Metric-Through-a-TDA-Approach/blob/master/poets_comparison.py) were the bottleneck distance computation of the experimentation is done.

In the folder [Results](https://github.com/Cimagroup/Towards-a-Philological-Metric-Through-a-TDA-Approach/tree/master/Results), the bottleneck distance values of 100 iterations of the algorithm is provided.

In the folder [Entropy_values](https://github.com/Cimagroup/Towards-a-Philological-Metric-Through-a-TDA-Approach/tree/master/Entropy_values), the entropy values of 100 iteration of the algorithm is provided.

An illustrative example using circumferences datasets can be seen in the jupyter notebook [Example circumferences.ipynb](https://github.com/Cimagroup/Towards-a-Philological-Metric-Through-a-TDA-Approach/blob/master/Example%20circumferences.ipynb)
