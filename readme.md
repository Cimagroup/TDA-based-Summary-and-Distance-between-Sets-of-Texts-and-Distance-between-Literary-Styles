# Towards a Philological Metric through a Topological Data Analysis Approach

This repository corresponds to the code used in the analogous
paper (to appear in ArXiv). 

The dataset used is part of the [CorpusSonetosSigloDeOro](https://github.com/bncolorado/CorpusSonetosSigloDeOro) repository.

In the folder [Results](https://github.com/Cimagroup/Towards-a-Philological-Metric-Through-a-TDA-Approach/tree/master/Results), the output of 100 iterations of the algorithm is provided.
